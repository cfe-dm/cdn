                        <p>Climate change is a national security challenge and the automotive innovations at work in Detroit can help the Defense Department tackle the climate crisis, Deputy Defense SEcretary Kathleen H. Hicks said. Speaking to a largely automotive audience at Wayne State University in Detroit, the deputy secretary said climate change is a crisis for the entire planet, and she cited President Joe Biden, who last week said climate change in ravaging the world. "It's not a hypothetical threat. Climate change is not a tomorrow problem. It's a problem right now," Hicks said.
