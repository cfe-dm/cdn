                        The Asia-Pacific Disaster Report (APDR) is a biennial publication of the Information and Communications Technology and Disaster Risk Reduction Division of the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific. Over the past two decades, many countries in Asia and the Pacific have strengthened their resilience against numerous natural calamities. Fewer people are dying as a result of natural hazards as countries have been devising more robust systems of early warning and responsive protection. But there is still a lot to be done. Most countries are still ill-prepared for multiple overlapping crises. Since the incursion of COVID-19 pandemic, the region has been hit by multiple natural and biological disasters, while climate change has continued to warm the world, exacerbating the impacts. The pandemic, combined with the persistent reality of climate change, has reshaped and expanded the Asia-Pacific riskscape. If the region is to achieve the goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, particularly Goal 1, Goal 9, Goal 11 and Goal 13, a hazard-by-hazard approach to disaster risk management is no longer viable./ The Asia-Pacific Disaster Report 2021 addresses the complexity of these converging and cascading risks by analysing hazards (natural and biological) simultaneously, presenting the impacts of cascading risks on populations and infrastructure under current, moderate and worst-case climate change scenarios. It focuses on five risk hotspots of particular concern. The report further estimates that annual economic losses arising from such cascading risks could almost double to US$ 1.344 billion equivalent to 4.2 percent of regional GDP under the worst case climate change scenario. Finally, the report makes the case for more purposeful and systematic national action with fiscal expenditure on resilience amounting to only a fifth of annualized losses or 0.85 percent of the GDP of the Asia-Pacific region, along with stronger subregional and regional cooperation as important adjuvants.

                        Climate change is a national security challenge and the automotive innovations at work in Detroit can help the Defense Department tackle the climate crisis, Deputy Defense SEcretary Kathleen H. Hicks said. Speaking to a largely automotive audience at Wayne State University in Detroit, the deputy secretary said climate change is a crisis for the entire planet, and she cited President Joe Biden, who last week said climate change in ravaging the world. "It's not a hypothetical threat. Climate change is not a tomorrow problem. It's a problem right now," Hicks said.

                        This US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) June 2014 Adaptation Plan update, prepared at the direction of the USACE Committee on Climate Preparedness and Resilience (CCPR), describes our vision, goals, and strategic approaches, our progress on priority areas, and how we plan, integrate, and evaluate measures to adapt to climate change and increase our preparedness and resilience. The plan will be updated annually and will be publicly available to our staff, partners and stakeholders following the required review by the White House. USACE tracks climate preparedness and resilience through annual metrics that address external collaboration, improving knowledge about climate impacts and adaptation, progress assessing vulnerability, and development of policy and guidance.  USACE established an overarching USACE Climate Change Adaptation Policy Statement and a governance structure to support mainstreaming adaptation in 2011 following the release of Executive Order 13514 and its Implementing Instructions. With the release of the President’s Climate Action Plan (PCAP) and Executive Order 13653, Preparing the United States for the Impacts of Climate Change, the policy has been updated as shown in the following section. Our policy requires USACE to mainstream climate change preparedness and resilience in all activities to help enhance the resilience of our built and natural water-resource infrastructure and the effectiveness of our military support mission, and to reduce potential vulnerabilities to the effects of climate change and variability. USACE is mainstreaming climate preparedness and resilience through four strategies: we focus on priority areas, we engage in external collaboration, we improve our understanding of climate change impacts and vulnerabilities, and we develop new policy and guidance to support adaptation implementation based on the best available and actionable science.
